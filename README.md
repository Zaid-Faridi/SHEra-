## 🏗️ Architecture

SHERa follows a **Modular, Component-Based Architecture** built on the **Expo Router** framework.

- **Navigation Pattern**: Centralized Floating Action Button (FAB) for AI interaction with a symmetrical 4-tab bar (Home, Wellness, Community, Insights).
- **State Management**: Robust use of React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`) combined with `AsyncStorage` for high-performance local data persistence.
- **Logic Layer**: Independent utility engines for:
    - `RiskScoreCalculation`: Algorithmic weightage of clinical symptoms.
    - `HormoneModeling`: Mathematical modeling of hormonal phases.
    - `CyclePrediction`: Date-based arithmetic for menstrual forecasting.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Expo](https://expo.dev/) / [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strictly typed for data integrity)

- **Styling**: Vanilla `StyleSheet` with a custom Design System (Pink/Lavender palette)
- **Charts**: `react-native-chart-kit`
